# ASTERIX DECODER

This project is a decoder and simulator of the information provided in the **ASTERIX** (All-purpose Structured EUROCONTROL Surveillance Information Exchange ) standard.
The surveillance sensors exchange information with this standarized format (ASTERIX) and to understand the information it is really important to understand how to decode this information.
The way of decoding this information is the core of the project.

ASTERIX classifies its information into different categories depending on the information exchanged. Each surveillance sensor has associated at least one category.
The category that has been decoded in this project is **CAT048**.
